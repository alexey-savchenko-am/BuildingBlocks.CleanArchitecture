**Reusable building blocks for .NET applications following Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.**

---

## üì¶ Overview

**BuildingBlocks.CleanArchitecture** is a set of libraries that implement core concepts of **Clean Architecture** and **DDD** for .NET applications. It provides abstractions and implementations for different layers:

- **Domain** ‚Äî entities, aggregates, value objects, domain events.
- **Application** ‚Äî commands, queries, handlers, and specifications.
- **Infrastructure** ‚Äî repository implementations, integrations with external services.
- **Presentation** ‚Äî API and web server tools

These libraries are designed for **reusability** and can be distributed as NuGet packages.

## üß± Solution Structure

The solution contains four main projects:

- `BuildingBlocks.CleanArchitecture.Domain` ‚Äî domain entities and business logic.
- `BuildingBlocks.CleanArchitecture.Application` ‚Äî command and query handlers.
- `BuildingBlocks.CleanArchitecture.Infrastructure` ‚Äî repository and integration implementations.
- `BuildingBlocks.CleanArchitecture.Presentation` ‚Äî API and web server tools.
